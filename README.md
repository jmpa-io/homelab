## `Why?`

<table>
<tr>
<td>

After moving to the other side of the world, I found myself in a job market where higher-level roles require different skills than I‚Äôm used to.

To adapt to this different job market, I've created this homelab setup to expand my knowledge from the cloud to on-prem.

I'm primarly a DevOps Engineer who has been focused on the cloud, but this setup gives me the option to easily run my own services in various languages that I'd like to try out.

## `How do I get started?`

To get started with this repository, you need a Proxmox host. If you're unsure how to do this, click [here](./proxmox/README.md).

This setup uses `3` Proxmox hosts, as of writing, which is configured in the [`inventory.yml`](./inventory.yml). You would need to configure this file to match the number of servers you're running.

Once this is setup, using a terminal, you can run:

```bash
make run-playbooks
```

And this repository should do the rest.

```bash
# You can also run:
make
# or
make help
# To see a list of available commands in this repository.
```
